# Command Usage

> Commands shown on this site are using the default prefix `!`, please note server admin's can change the prefix to best suit their community.

> Example message entry in Discord for `!set [tc|fc|trainer-code|friend-code] <trainer_code>` would be `!set tc 111122223333` or `!set trainer-code 111122223333`.

.. Note:: when a command has an input of ``<verbose=True>`` this means Nexus will return a response by default. To override the command response enter ``False``.

   Example: ``!create role <arg> <verbose=True>``
