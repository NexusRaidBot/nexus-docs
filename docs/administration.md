## Inviting Nexus 

To invite Nexus to your community, please visit the <a href="https://top.gg/bot/761036478783422484" target="_blank">Top.gg</a>, and click on the invite button.

Once Nexus is added to your server, it will immediately create a new channel called `#nexus-updates`. This channel is used for update notifications and the `nexus-moderator` role for people who want to run administration commands.

## Configuring Nexus

### Raiding

You need to setup your raid channel with `!server raid-channel #channel`. The raid channel is a special channel in which all raids will be.

### Cross-server raids

You need to setup the channel in which you'll receive raids from other servers with `!server online-channel #channel`. You can send your raid to other servers by running `!go-live` inside a raid.


### Setup Your Mods

Once Nexus is configured, add all your mods and admins to the `nexus-moderators` role.
