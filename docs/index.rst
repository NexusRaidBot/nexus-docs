Trainer's Guide
===================================

**Welcome, Trainer!**

This is the official Nexus Trainer's Guide!

Nexus is a Discord Bot that organizes remote raids for Pokémon Go, no matter where you are. It has incorporated a reaction role system, both a generic reaction role and an easy-to-use Pokémon reaction role to subscribe to Pokémon roles, with automatic custom emojis. Raids will be posted with role mentions to notify people, and weather boosted raids are supported by Nexus as well. You can even raid across servers!

Features:

* Raid creation. Only raids of Pokémon that are currently in rotation can be created. You can also input the time remaining in the raid, but it defaults to 45 minutes if no time is given. You can send your raid to other servers and receive raids from other servers as well. Screenshot scanning of the boss is available as well.

* Trainer profiles to set your in-game name, friend code and level. This carries across servers.

* Trainers are forced to set their in-game name to join a raid.

* Trainers are forced to set their friend code to create a raid.

* Close a raid at any time to prevent people from joining.

* Modify the maximum amount of trainers that can be invited to a raid.

* Mark your raid as only hosting (and not actually joining).

* Only the trainers inside a raid and nexus-moderators can see and interact with the raid.

* Easy reaction role system for Pokémon, shiny eligible Pokémon appear with a shiny emoji automatically and permaboosted Pokémon (verified by TSR) appear marked as well. The Pokémon are organized by tiers without any extra input needed from the admin. You can include weather boosted roles as well.

* Create and delete roles.

* Create Pokémon emoji.

* Delete Pokémon emoji.

* Generic reaction role implementation.

* Toggle weather boosted raids on/off.

And much more features coming in the future!
