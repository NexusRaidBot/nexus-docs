> Once Nexus is added to your server, it will immediately create a new channel called `#nexus-updates`. This channel is used for update notifications and the `nexus-moderator` role for people who want to run administration commands.

## Configuring Nexus

### Raiding

> You need to setup your raid channel with `!server raid-channel <#channel>`. The raid channel is a special channel in which all raids will be.

###  Cross-server raids

> You need to setup the channel in which you'll receive raids from other servers with `!server online-channel <#channel>`. You can send your raid to other servers by running `!go-live` inside a raid.

### Setup Your Mods

> Once Nexus is configured, add all your mods and admins to the `nexus-moderators` role.

### Setup Your Profile

> Before a user can raid, three profile settings must be set that matches your PokÃ©mon Go profile:

> > 1. ``!set ign mycoolname`` This will set the in game name.
> > 2. ``!set tc 111122223333`` This will set your friend code.
> > 3. ``!set level 50`` This will set your current trainer level.
