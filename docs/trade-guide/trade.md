   ``!set location  <latitude> <longitude>``, "Use this to set your location for trading purposes. Your location can't be seen by anyone. You need to input your latitude and longitude."
   ``!trade``, "Use this to search for trainers on the discord server which are in the valid trading range. If there are no bonuses (40km), this will search for trainers within a 1km radius."
