# Slash Commands

> Slash commands are the brand new magic from Discord. You can bring up all slash commands by typing `/`, and you can follow instructions, choose parameters and receive responses only you can see.

```eval_rst

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Command", "Description"
   :widths: 20, 80

   ``/set-country <country>``, "Use this to set your country. You can give this the name of the country or the country code. (e.g. United States or US)."
   ``/set-ign <ign>``, "Use this to set your in-game name."
   ``/set-level <level>``, "Use this to set your level. You can set it to a maximum of 50."
   ``/set-tc <trainer_code>``, "Use this to set your trainer code."
   ``/set-team <team>``, "Use this to set your team. The available teams are mystic, valor and instinct."

.. Note:: Existing servers will have to re-invite Nexus to allow these sort of commands to run (don't worry, this won't affect anything on your server other than giving more permissions to Nexus).
