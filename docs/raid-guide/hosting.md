# Hosting Raids

### Raid Command

> The `!raid` command in Nexus is the primary method for Host to create raids and can be used in any channel. It can be used simply as `!r` or as a full meal deal. All command `<inputs>` are optional but must be used in order otherwise Nexus will give an error. 

```eval_rst

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Command", "Options / Flags"
   :widths: 5, 20

   ``![raid|r]``, "``<1> <2> <flags>``"

```

#### Raid Command Inputs/Flags

```eval_rst

.. csv-table::
   :header: "#", "Input", "Description"
   :widths: 2, 5, 18

   ``<1>``, ``<pokemon>``, "Use this to set the Raid Boss."
   ``<2>``, ``<time_left=45>``, "Use this to set the time left in raid (1-45)."

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Flag", "Possible Values", "Description"
   :widths: 2, 5, 18

   ``weather-boosted``, ``true/false``, "Use this to indicate the raid is weather boosted"
   ``invites-limit``, ``0-10``, "Use this to set the invite limit"
   ``only-hosting``, ``true/false``, "Use this to set only hosting"
   ``min_level``, ``1-50``, "Use this to set minimum Trainer level."
   ``train``, ``1+``, "Use this to set how many times the raid will advance. See `Raid Train`_."
   ``rehost``, ``true/false``, "Use this to indicate the raid is a rehost."
   
.. Note:: You can input the name of the flag followed by its value (flag:value), you can either separate flags with a space or with quotes ("flag: value" flag:value), and for flags that are either true or false, by just mentioning the flag the true value will be assumed ("weather-boosted" instead of "weather-boosted:true").

   All flags have its corresponding command, and aliases can be used as well. You'll also skip the raid setup if you input at least one flag.

   You can input all the flags you want, but you can also just input the values in the following order (you don't need to input all of them): [weather-boosted] [invites-limit] [only-hosting] [minimum-level] [train] [rehost]

```

### Screenshots

> In the "raid-channel" setup for the community, Trainers can simply upload a screenshot of the Raid Boss to create a raid, and Nexus will walk through the steps necessary to start the raid.

```eval_rst

.. Note:: Nexus has a 20 screenshot limit per month among all servers. Screenshots that are not able to be recognized do not count towards this limit. You will always be able to initiate a raid via the ``!raid`` command, even if you exceed the screenshot limit. Nexus will mention you in the "setup channel" if you run out of screenshots and react with a ðŸ›‘. If you would like to increase that limit please see :doc:`Donations<../donation>` to learn more.
