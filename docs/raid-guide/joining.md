# Joining Raids

> In the "raid-channel" setup for the community, Trainers can join raids by clicking the "raid pass", and Nexus will prompt the Trainer to join the raid lobby.

### Raid Lobby Commands

```eval_rst

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Command", "Description"
   :widths: 5, 20

   ``!bye``, "Use this to leave a raid. If you are the Host the raid will end."
   ``!host``, "Use this in a raid to get information from the host."
   ``!ready``, "Use this to mark yourself as ready inside a raid."
   ``!time-left <minutes>``, "Use this in a raid to see how much time is left on the raid. If you are the host, you can give this command the amount of minutes that are left on your raid to update it."
   ``!unready``, "Use this to mark yourself as unready inside a raid."

.. Tip:: Nexus recognizes the word ``ready`` in the raid lobby so using ``!ready`` is optional.
